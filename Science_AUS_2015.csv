Living things have a variety of external features
Living things live in different places where their needs are met
Everyday materials can be physically changed in a variety of ways
Observable changes occur in the sky and landscape
Light and sound are produced by a range of sources and can be sensed
"Science involves observing, asking questions about, and describing changes in, objects and events"
"People use science in their daily lives, including when caring for their environment and living things"
"Pose and respond to questions, and make predictions about familiar objects and events"
Participate in guided investigations to explore and answer questions
"Use informal measurements to collect and record observations, using digital technologies as appropriate"
"Use a range of methods to sort information, including drawings and provided tables and through discussion, compare observations with predictions"
Compare observations with those of others
Represent and communicate observations and ideas in a variety of ways 
"Living things grow, change and have offspring similar to themselves"
Different materials can be combined for a particular purpose

Represent and communicate observations and ideas in a variety of ways
Living things can be grouped on the basis of observable features and can be distinguished from non-living things
Science involves making predictions and describing patterns and relationships
"With guidance, identify questions in familiar contexts that can be investigated scientifically and make predictions based on prior knowledge"
A change of state between solid and liquid can be caused by adding or removing heat
"With guidance, plan and conduct scientific investigations to find answers to questions, considering the safe use of appropriate materials and equipment"
"Consider the elements of fair tests and use formal measurements and digital technologies as appropriate, to make and record observations accurately"
"Earth劌製 rotation on its axis causes regular changes, including night and day"
Science knowledge helps people to understand the effect of their actions
Use a range of methods including tables and simple column graphs to represent data and to identify patterns and trends
"Compare results with predictions, suggesting possible reasons for findings"
"Reflect on investigations, including whether a test was fair or not"
Heat can be produced in many ways and can move from one object to another
"Represent and communicate observations, ideas and findings using formal and informal representations"
Living things have life cycles

Earth劌製 surface changes over time as a result of natural processes and human activity
Forces can be exerted by one object on another through direct contact or from a distance
Science knowledge helps people to understand the effect of their actions
Use a range of methods including tables and simple column graphs to represent data and to identify patterns and trends
"Compare results with predictions, suggesting possible reasons for findings"
"Reflect on investigations, including whether a test was fair or not"
"Represent and communicate observations, ideas and findings using formal and informal representations"
Living things have structural features and adaptations that help them to survive in their environment
Science involves testing predictions by gathering data and using evidence to develop explanations of events and phenomena and reflects historical and cultural contributions
"With guidance, pose clarifying questions and make predictions about scientific investigations"
"Identify, plan and apply the elements of scientific investigations to answer questions and solve problems using equipment and materials safely and identifying potential risks"
"Decide variables to be changed and measured in fair tests, and observe measure and record data with accuracy using digital technologies as appropriate"
The Earth is part of a system of planets orbiting around a star
Scientific knowledge is used to solve problems and inform personal and community decisions
"Construct and use a range of representations, including tables and graphs, to represent and describe observations, patterns or relationships in data using digital technologies as appropriate"
Compare data with predictions and use as evidence in developing explanations
"Light from a source forms shadows and can be absorbed, reflected and refracted"
Reflect on and suggest improvements to scientific investigations
