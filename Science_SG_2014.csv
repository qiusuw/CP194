There is a great variety of living and non-living things in the world. Man seeks to organise this great variety of living and non-living things to better understand the world in which he lives. There are common threads that connect all living things and unifying factors in the diversity of non-living things that help him to classify them. This theme brings across the importance of maintaining diversity.
Describe the characteristics of living things.
Observe a variety of living and nonliving things and infer differences between them.
Classify living things into broad groups (in plants and animals) based on similarities and differences of common observable characteristics.
"Relate the use of various types of materials (ceramic, fabric, glass, metal, plastics, rubber, wood) to their physical properties"
Observe and compare the life cycles of plants grown from seeds over a period of time.
Show an understanding that different living things have different life cycles
"Observe and compare the life cycles of animals over a period of time (butterfly, beetle, mosquito, grasshopper, cockroach, chicken, frog)."
Show an understanding that living things reproduce to ensure continuity of their kind and that many characteristics of an organism are passed on from parents to offspring.
Recognise processes in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants.
Investigate the various ways in which plants reproduce and communicate findings.
Recognise the similarity in terms of fertilisation in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants and humans.
Recognise that water can exist in three interchangeable states of matter.
Show an understanding of how water changes from one state to another.
Show an understanding of the terms melting point of ice (or freezing point of water) and boiling point of water.
Show an understanding of the roles of evaporation and condensation in the water cycle.
Recognise the importance of the water cycle.
Recognise the importance of water to life processes.
Describe the impact of water pollution on Earth‰Ûªs water resources.
State the melting point of ice (or freezing point of water) and boiling point of water.
Recognise the changes in states of water in the water cycle.
"Identify the organ systems and state their functions in human (digestive, respiratory, circulatory, skeletal and muscular)."
There are repeated patterns of change in nature. Examples of these cycles are the life cycles of living things and the water cycle. Understanding these cycles helps Man to predict events and processes and to appreciate the Earth as a self-sustaining system.
A system is a whole consisting of parts that work together to perform a function(s). There are systems in nature as well as man-made systems. Examples of systems in nature are the digestive and respiratory systems. Examples of man-made systems are electrical systems. Understanding these systems allows Man to understand how they operate and how parts influence and interact with one another to perform a function.
"Studying the interactions between and within systems enhances understanding of the environment and Man‰Ûªs role in it. Interactions occur within an organism, between organisms as well as between organisms and the environment. The interaction of Man with the environment drives the development of Science and Technology. At the same time, Science and Technology influences the way Man interacts with the environment. By understanding the interactions between Man and the environment, students can better appreciate the consequences of their actions and be responsible for their actions."
Energy makes changes and movement possible in everyday life. Man uses various forms of energy for many different purposes. Man is not the only animal that needs energy; all living things obtain energy and use it to carry out life processes. Understanding this theme will allow students to appreciate the importance and uses of energy and the need to conserve it.
"Recognise that air is a mixture of gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapour."
Identify the organs of the human respiratory and circulatory systems and describe their functions.
"Recognise that air is a mixture of gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapour."
Identify the organs of the human respiratory and circulatory systems and state their functions.
Identify the different parts of plants and state their functions.
Identify the parts of the plant transport system and describe their functions.
Recognise how water is transported from the roots to other parts of the plant and how food is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
Show an understanding that a cell is a basic unit of life.
Identify the different parts of a typical plant cell and animal cell and relate the parts to the functions.
"Recognise that an electric circuit consisting of an energy source (battery) and other circuit components (wire, bulb, switch) forms an electrical system."
Show an understanding that a current can only flow in a closed circuit.
Identify electrical conductors and insulators.
Investigate the effect of some variables on the current in a circuit and communicate findings.
"Recognise that an electric circuit consisting of an energy source (battery) and other circuit components (wire, bulb, switch) forms an electrical system."
Recognise that a magnet can exert a push or a pull.
Identify electrical conductors and insulators.
Show an understanding of the effects of a force.
Recognise and give examples of the different types of forces.
Identify the factors that affect the survival of an organism.
Discuss the effect on organisms when the environment becomes unfavourable (organisms adapt and survive; move to other places or die).
"Differentiate among the terms organism, population and community."
"Trace the energy pathway from the Sun through living things and identify the roles of various organisms (producers, consumers, predators, prey) in a food chain and a food web."
"Show an understanding that different habitats support different communities (garden, field, pond, seashore, tree, mangrove swamp)."
Recognise that adaptations serve to enhance survival and can be structural or behavioural.
