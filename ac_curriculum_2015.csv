VCSSU123,The atomic structure and properties of elements are used to organise them in the periodic table
VCSSU124,Chemical reactions involve rearranging atoms to form new substances; during a chemical reaction mass is not created or destroyed
VCSSU125,Different types of chemical reactions are used to produce a range of products and can occur at different rates; chemical reactions may be represented by balanced chemical equations
VCSSU126,"Chemical reactions, including combustion and the reactions of acids, are important in both non-living and living systems and involve energy transfer"
VCSSU127,The theory of plate tectonics explains global patterns of geological activity and continental movement
VCSSU128,"Global systems, including the carbon cycle, rely on interactions involving the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere"
VCSSU129,"The Universe contains features including galaxies, stars and solar systems; the Big Bang theory can be used to explain the origin of the Universe"
VCSSU130,Electric circuits can be designed for diverse purposes using different components; the operation of circuits can be explained by the concepts of voltage and current
VCSSU131,The interaction of magnets can be explained by a field model; magnets are used in the generation of electricity and the operation of motors
VCSSU132,Energy flow in Earth’s atmosphere can be explained by the processes of heat transfer
VCSSU133,The description and explanation of the motion of objects involves the interaction of forces and the exchange of energy and can be described and predicted using the laws of physics
VCCCG028,"Discuss the role of political parties and independent representatives in Australia’s system of government, including the formation of governments, and explain the process through which government policy is shaped and developed"
VCCCTQ043,Investigate the characteristics of effective questions in different contexts to examine information and test possibilities
